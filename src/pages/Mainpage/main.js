            <h5 id="maincontent">Overall management of municipal solid waste (MSW) across America is
              currently in fair condition. In many cases the transport and disposal of
               MSW is self-funding and managed by the private sector, and therefore is
                sufficiently funded. Americans annually generate about 258 million
                tons of MSW of which approximately 53% is deposited in landfills â€“
                a share that has plateaued in recent years. Currently, 35% of MSW is
                 recycled and 13% is combusted for energy production. There is a need
                 to change the way we think of how solid waste is generated, managed,
                 and potentially used as a resource. We need to recognize that what is
                 routinely discarded may in fact be a reusable resource.
